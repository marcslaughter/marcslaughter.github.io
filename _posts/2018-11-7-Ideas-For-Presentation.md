title: I Might Actually Have Something to Talk About
---

Last [post](https://marcslaughter.github.io/Path-Creation/) I set a goal to attend infosec meetups and whatnot throughout the DC area.  I'm told [NOVA Hackers](httpsL//twitter.com/NOVAHackers) is really good.  Their rule forces participation and presentation.  Once cannot be a passive member of NOVA Hackers.  So to attend, I need to present something, but I'm an infosec novice, what do I have to offer?  We'll get there.

### My Relationship with Authority
