### The importance of writing it down

The fastest way I could find to just get started in a semi-public place to write is on Github with Jekyll, so here we are.  For the past year or so, I have found that I enjoy (and have something of an affinity for) basic information security.  Really, I watched some [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) and [Derek Rook](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMACXuWd2w6_IEGog744UaA) videos on youtube and followed along in my own Kali VM.  I started following various personalities on twitter, and found myself spending more and more time on the site or in the app (time management is a topic for another day, I think) and slowly realized that ideally, my post-military-retirement career would be in the infosec field.

As I said, a year or so.  That's too long with no defined version of success.  I have less than 5 years before I retire so I'm blessed with the ability to build toward whatever the end-state happens to be.  For now, I'll keep that end-state vague and just say that my ultimate goal is a _career in the infosec field_ upon retirement.  Maybe somewhere in this journey that will focus toward pen-testing, incident response, red team, etc. 

Cool, a vague goal, now what?  Well, that's why I'm writing this.  I've spent too long with dreams and the path to their achievement stuck floating around in my head.  Do I keep watching youtube videos on [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) machines and following along?  Do I dive into certifications?  Really, who cares.  I just need to do something, work toward something objective and measurable.  That can be a root own on HTB per week (with or without walkthrough assistance, video or otherwise) or it can be movement toward a cert of some sort.  Here's where I write it down.  All that said, this plan can change, but it needs to change _from_ something.  I need a plan so I have something to adjust.  It needs to get out of my head on onto, well, a github blog.

### The plan

Ok, I need consistency and measurable goals.  Let's just throw some shit out there that's floating around in my head and then we'll prioritize, categorize, and temporalize (woah, that's actually a word, I just googled it).

* HTB
* General Reading (/r/netsec, twitter, darkreading, etc)
* Certs
  - Sec+
  - SANS
  - eLearnSecurity
  - OffSec
* Meetups / Cons

Ok.  That last one is, I think, possibly the most important and easist to implement.  Go.  Marc - Go to conferences and meetups.  I'm in DC for another 20 months or so.  [DC202](https://twitter.com/202hackers?lang=en) meets occasionally.  Go.  [NOVA Hackers](https://twitter.com/novahackers) meets on the second Monday of every month.  Go.  This one is hard though, because NOVA Hackers has a presentation requirement.  One can only be in the group if one actively contributes to the group.  I need to do that.  So, measurable goal: present at NOVA Hackers in December.  I don't know what I'll present on, but that's for later.  More measurability: **determine presentation topic by 20 Nov and have slides ready by 3 Dec**.  For Cons, I might be limited by my ability to F5.  I already have BSides NOVA tickets, so I'll go to that.  _If_ I can get shmoocon tickets, I'll go to that to.  Which presentation path I'll take is probably worthy of another blog post, but for now... I'll _go_.

General reading is a bit too nebulous, so we'll leave it out of the realm of goals for now.  HTB, though.  Lets spend at least 2 hours on an non-retired HTB machine per week.  That's doable right?  I think that will foster the creative and critical thinking that cert studying can't really do, book cert studying anyway, while keeping up with familiarization of tools and techniques.  I need to do things on my own a bit more.  Thanks ippsec and r00k, but it's time I at least lengthen the apron strings, if not cut them entirely.

Now, on to certs.  I hear OSCP is sort of the gold standard, but it's also hard and not accepted by the government for whatever information assurance standards they have.  I don't necessarily want a government job, but hey, it's worth applying to the consideration calculous.  That said, in the interest of attainability, I think it would be better to start with something cheaper and easier.  I honestly believe that I can pass Sec+ with a book or two and consistent studying.  I think that that is a good starting point for certs.  I'll have the self-debate later as to whether or not I should try "challenging" a SANS cert later (maybe GSEC or GCIH) to maximize my remaining G.I. Bill benefits.  Then maybe I can finish off that G.I. Bill with a SANS graduate certificate.  Again, something to consider later.

#### Daily/Weekly Goals - Routine Building

* 30 minutes of cert studying per day (hey, it's a start)
  - I'll shoot for right after the kids go to bed
* 2 hours of unguided HTB work per week
  - Likely a weekend task
* Minimum once per week writing here
  - Document what works / doesn't
  - "Workshop" presentation ideas or write through a problem
  - Goal status, goal changes
  
#### Long Term Goal

* Sec+ by June 2019
  - Schedule the test in March 2019
* GSEC by January 2020
* I'm going to write it down, but it seems so far off - OSCP by January 2023

Let's get started...
