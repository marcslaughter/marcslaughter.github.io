## A Book, a Real-Life Book

I've been reading.  Or, more precisely, I've been listening to a book while driving.  ["The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck" by Mark Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F*ck) seems to be helping my mindset.  It's not perfect.  It has echoes of [/r/wowthanksimcured](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowthanksimcured/) in that sometimes his advice for action is... "just do it."  I'm woefully oversimplifying, but you get the point.

I'll get to a couple of thoughts from my ~2/3 completion in a bit, but for now I want to talk about my reading habits.  Look, I'm lazy; not in one of those proud of being lazy ways either.  I am deeply ashamed of my procrastination habits and have come to rely on my general, I dunno, smartness to get things done.  Some time ago I might have said that I work better under the pressure of a tighter deadline, so the work that I do in an hour, despite having 3 days to do it, is just as good as if I had filled the full 3 days.  That's bullshit, but it was my rationalization.  Now, I just get pissed at myself for procrastinating, but still do it.  It's not the worst in the world, and I'm working on it, but you get the picture.

Back to reading.  My non-work reading of late has consisted of tweets, skimming blog posts if they seem interesting (usually found on twitter), and falling asleep to the third book of the Wheel of Time after about 3 pages (kindle pages, so probably half a real page).  That's bad.  I don't have a fully developed action plan to address this but here's what I've come up with on a fast crappy brainstorm session: finish this book while commuting, avoiding podcasts until then; write a little bit about what I've read.  It doesn't have to be a blog post, just jot some stuff down in my phone's notes app or in a notebook; get the fuck off social media except in a strictly regulated fashion.  I haven't figured that fashion out yet, but I'm thinking something like 10 minute increments during commute (the line standing part), lunch, opposite commute, and an evening sesh sometime.  I'll work the gritty details out tomorrow (there I go procrastinating).  No one's going to read this so I'll just commit it and write more tomorrow.  Fortunately I have phone notes from right after I read.
